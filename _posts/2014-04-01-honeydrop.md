Honeydrop is a tea brand that uses honey to sweeten their drinks instead of sugar and revitalizes many values that were inherent in the hippie movement in the 70's. This became a source of inspiration in my concept for redesigning their current logo and packaging. The logo was inspired by 70's typefaces as well as the bottle design, that uses an abstracted paisley pattern that can also be read as drops of liquid. My main intention was to not rewrite the brand's existing values but to shape it to be more energetic and eye-catching.
