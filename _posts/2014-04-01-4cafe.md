  <div class="description">
My concept for 4 Cafe was to focus on the brand's four utmost importances that they take cater to their customers: fresh, organic, local and seasonal. I created a logo that used the four different colors of the seasons and used rounded rectangles that were inspired from the restaurant's interior use of reclaimed wood. The rebranding concept includes a new logo, menu, and app design that allows users to order their food to-go ahead of time.
